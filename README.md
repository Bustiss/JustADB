# JustADB Development Process

This project outlines the development process for JustADB, a web application that integrates a Flask backend with a React frontend and MongoDB for data storage.

## Development Steps

1. **Project Structure Setup**
   - Create folders for frontend, backend, and database.
   - Install necessary dependencies for Flask, React, MongoDB, and supporting libraries.
   - Set up basic Flask app and React app with routing.

2. **User Authentication**
   - Implement JWT-based login/logout with MongoDB.
   - Create user registration, login, and authentication middleware in Flask.
   - Build React components for sign-up, login, and logout with protected routes.

3. **Data Analysis Backend**
   - Develop Flask routes for data uploads and processing.
   - Integrate Pandas and NumPy for handling and analyzing uploaded data.
   - Return analysis results as JSON for the frontend to display.
   - Use Recharts in React for visualizing results dynamically.

4. **Network Sharing Feature**
   - Create MongoDB collections for network contacts.
   - Build React UI for adding network contacts and sharing results.
   - Implement Flask API routes to send result links or data to selected network contacts.
